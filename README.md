## ☁️ 100 Days of AWS Cloud Challenge (Console-Based)

## 📌 Overview

This repository documents my 100 Days of AWS Cloud Challenge, a hands-on journey focused on building real-world cloud infrastructure skills using the AWS Management Console.

All tasks are performed directly in the AWS Console to demonstrate a strong understanding of:
  - AWS services
  - Configuration workflows
  - Cloud architecture concepts
  - Security and networking fundamentals

This repository serves as a public cloud portfolio for recruiters and hiring managers.

🎯 Objectives
  - Build strong AWS fundamentals through practical implementation
  - Gain real experience with compute, networking, storage, IAM, and monitoring
  - Understand how AWS services are configured in real environments
  - Maintain clear documentation and visual proof of work


  📸 Proof of Work

Each task includes:
  - AWS Console configuration steps
  - Screenshots validating successful implementation
  - Clear outcome and learning summary

This repository reflects actual AWS console experience, not simulations or theory.
